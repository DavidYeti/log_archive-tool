# Log Archive Tool
I built a tool to archive logs from the CLI with the date and time.

In this project, I built a tool to archive logs on a set schedule by compressing 
them and storing them in a new directory, this is especially useful for removing 
old logs and keeping the system clean while maintaining the logs in a compressed 
format for future reference. 

This project helped me practice my programming skills, including working 
with files and directories, and building a simple cli tool.
